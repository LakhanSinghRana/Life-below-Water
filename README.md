Life Below Water is a web-based project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to raise awareness about the importance of conserving marine life and ecosystems. Inspired by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 14, this project highlights the beauty, diversity, and challenges faced by aquatic life due to pollution, overfishing, and climate change.

The website features interactive content, engaging visuals, and informative sections aimed at educating users about ocean conservation. Animations and responsive design ensure an immersive user experience across devices. JavaScript is used to enhance interactivity, such as animated transitions, dynamic elements, and user-triggered content.

This project is ideal for educational purposes, campaigns, or as a creative portfolio piece for web development. It reflects a strong message of sustainability through a simple yet impactful digital platform.

Feel free to explore, share, and contribute to help spread awareness and protect our oceans.
